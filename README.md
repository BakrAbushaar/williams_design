**Instructor Contact:**
If you have merge issues, conceptual questions, or want feedback ‚Äî open an **Issue** in your repo or ask during lab.

Would you like me to generate a matching **repo template folder** (with all empty `.md` files pre-created, including placeholder comments and instructions inside each) that you can zip and upload to GitHub Classroom?  
That would let students instantly fork a structured starting point with no setup friction.
