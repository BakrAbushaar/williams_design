### Learn to collaborate, think strategically, and design with purpose

In this project, a team of 2–3 students will learn how brands use psychology, design, and storytelling to connect with people, and how to use GitHub to collaborate like real designers and developers.

## Team collaboration and deliverables

For teams of 2–3 students using your OWN team repository (do not commit to the instructor’s repo):
- Each student completes TWO pages total:
  1) ONE topic research page: choose exactly one of Archetype, Persuasion, or Sales Funnel and complete the template under `docs/`
  2) ONE competitor analysis page: copy `docs/competitors/competitor-template.md` and rename it for your competitor (for example, `docs/competitors/starbucks.md`)

Organize links to all student pages in this README so the instructor can find everything quickly. Example:

```
## Team Pages

### Student A (Name)
- Topic: Archetype — docs/archetype.md
- Competitor: Starbucks — docs/competitors/starbucks.md

### Student B (Name)
- Topic: Persuasion — docs/persuasion.md
- Competitor: Dunkin — docs/competitors/dunkin.md

### Student C (Name)
- Topic: Sales Funnel — docs/sales-funnel.md
- Competitor: Blue Bottle — docs/competitors/blue-bottle.md
```

Recommended workflow to minimize merge conflicts:
- Step 1 (repo owner): Create your OWN team repository and add the empty files everyone will need:
  - `docs/archetype.md`, `docs/persuasion.md`, `docs/sales-funnel.md`
  - One competitor file per teammate (e.g., `docs/competitors/student-a.md`, `docs/competitors/student-b.md`) or use actual competitor names if known
- Step 2: Push to GitHub.
- Step 3: Collaboration options:
  - Option A (simpler): Add teammates as collaborators to the same repo. Each student creates a branch and opens PRs in this repo.
  - Option B (more advanced): Each student forks the team repo. Work in your fork and open PRs back to the team repo.
- Step 4: Each student edits only their two assigned pages and opens a Pull Request.
- Step 5: After review, merge PRs to main and update the README “Team Pages” section with links to the final filenames.

Naming guidance for competitor files:
- Final naming: `docs/competitors/<brand-name>.md` (e.g., `docs/competitors/starbucks.md`)
- If the brand isn’t chosen yet: temporarily use `docs/competitors/<student-name>.md`, then rename when finalized and update the README link.

Submission:
- Submit your team GitHub repository URL on Canvas. Ensure this README links to all research and competitor pages for each teammate.

Definition of Done (check before submitting):
- [ ] Each student completed 2 pages (1 topic + 1 competitor)
- [ ] README has a “Team Pages” section with working links to every student’s two pages
- [ ] All PRs reviewed and merged to main
- [ ] Repo URL submitted on Canvas

## Deployment & site customization (SageShield AI marketing site)

This repository now includes a single-page marketing site under `docs/` intended to be published with GitHub Pages. The site is a small, accessible marketing landing page for "SageShield AI" — a fictional enterprise AI & cybersecurity advisory designed with a Sage archetype voice.

How it is deployed
- A GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on push to `main` and deploys the contents of `docs/` to the `gh-pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`.
- After the action runs you can serve the site by configuring GitHub Pages in the repository Settings → Pages to use the `gh-pages` branch. The site URL will be:

  `https://BakrAbushaar.github.io/williams_design/`

Customize the Calendly link and social links
- The site uses a placeholder Calendly link: `https://calendly.com/sageshield/30min`. Replace it in `docs/index.html` with your real Calendly scheduling link.
- The social links point to `https://www.youtube.com/@SageShieldAI` and `https://instagram.com/SageShieldAI` — update those anchors in `docs/index.html` to your real channels.

Accessibility and notes
- The page includes WCAG-friendly features: a skip link, keyboard support for the slider (Left/Right arrows), focus-visible outlines, and reduced-motion respect.
- Styling is in `docs/css/styles.css` and JavaScript is in `docs/js/main.js`.

Local testing
- Preview locally by opening `docs/index.html` or run a local static server (recommended). From the repo root:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory docs 8000
```

CI validation
- A workflow `.github/workflows/html-validate.yml` runs `html-validate` and produces a JSON report artifact; this helps catch markup issues before deployment.

Next steps
- I can update the site further if you want:
  - Replace the placeholder SVG logo at `docs/images/logo.svg` with your brand logo (upload file or point me to it).
  - Generate a PNG OG image and swap `docs/images/og-image.svg` with a PNG for broader compatibility.
  - Add a small Lighthouse CI job to the Actions pipeline.

## Tips for success

- Communicate regularly with your team using GitHub Discussions or chat
- Commit often — don't wait until the end
- Reference real brands and include visuals where possible
- Keep your Markdown clean and readable
- Be curious; this project is about learning how ideas shape design

### End goal

By the end of this project, your team will have:
- A clear understanding of how branding and persuasion work online
