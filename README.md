# üß© Brand Strategy Research Project

### Learn to Collaborate, Think Strategically, and Design with Purpose

In this project, you and your teammates will learn how **brands use psychology, design, and storytelling** to connect with people ‚Äî and how to use **GitHub** to work together like real developers and designers.

You‚Äôll explore:
- **Brand Archetypes** (the personality behind a brand)
- **Cialdini‚Äôs Principles of Persuasion**
- **Sales Funnels** (how websites turn visitors into customers)
- **Competitor Analysis** (how real companies use these ideas online)

Then you‚Äôll bring it all together by researching a real product or business category (like coffee, pizza, gyms, etc.) and building your own simple, well-researched brand strategy website.

## üß≠ Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Work as a team to research, write, and organize information about your chosen business type ‚Äî using GitHub to collaborate safely without overwriting each other‚Äôs work.

Each student will take ownership of **one topic** (archetype, persuasion, funnel, or a competitor) and contribute their findings in Markdown files inside a shared GitHub repository.

By the end, your team will have created:
- A small **knowledge base** on brand psychology and marketing strategy  
- A **collaborative research workflow** using GitHub branches and pull requests  
- The foundation for your **first team website project**

---

## üß∞ Repository Structure

Your team‚Äôs repo should look like this:

```

/docs
archetype.md
persuasion.md
sales-funnel.md
/competitors/
competitor1.md
competitor2.md
competitor3.md
README.md

```

üü¢ *Tip:* Use folders to stay organized. Each `.md` file is a research page.

**Instructor Contact:**
If you have merge issues, conceptual questions, or want feedback ‚Äî open an **Issue** in your repo or ask during lab.

Would you like me to generate a matching **repo template folder** (with all empty `.md` files pre-created, including placeholder comments and instructions inside each) that you can zip and upload to GitHub Classroom?  
That would let students instantly fork a structured starting point with no setup friction.
