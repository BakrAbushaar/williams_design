## Key Takeaways for Our Strategy

### What We Can Learn
**Archetype Lessons:** Use research-backed content but make it easier to consume for procurement and executives.

**Persuasion Lessons:** Use authority and reciprocity‚Äîpublish frameworks and short downloadable guides that help buyers make decisions.

**Funnel Lessons:** Provide both deep technical docs and short executive briefs to serve multiple stakeholders.

### What We Should Do Differently
- Move faster with productized pilots and clear pricing bands for small-to-medium enterprise projects.

### Specific Implementation Ideas
1. Produce a 2-page executive brief for every long-form whitepaper.
2. Create a standardized pilot SOW that can be converted into a contract quickly.
3. Offer a technical kit (APIs, sample configs) to accelerate engineering evaluation.
