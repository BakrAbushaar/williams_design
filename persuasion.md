## 1. Reciprocity
> *"People feel obligated to return favors and treat others as they have been treated."*

#### Example 1: CrowdStrike — Threat Reports & Free Resources
**Website:** https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/
**What they offer:** Regular threat research reports, incident response case studies, and downloadable briefing documents.
**How it works:** These reports are gated behind a simple form; visitors receive high-value intelligence in exchange for contact details.
**Why it's effective:** The reports demonstrate authority and provide immediate value; businesses that consume the content are more likely to engage for paid services.

#### Example 2: IBM — Whitepapers and Toolkits
**Website:** https://www.ibm.com/insights
**What they offer:** Research whitepapers, case studies, and downloadable frameworks for AI governance and security.
**How it works:** IBM publishes in-depth resources that help buyers scope projects and justify budgets.
**Why it's effective:** Sharing deep, research-backed content positions IBM as a trusted advisor and primes enterprise buyers for consultation engagements.
### How Brands Use Reciprocity

**Common Examples:**
- Free samples or trials
- Free shipping
- Valuable free content (guides, tools, resources)
- Loyalty programs and rewards
- Unexpected bonuses or gifts

Scarcity creates urgency. In enterprise contexts, scarcity is often framed as limited consulting capacity, limited pilot slots, or exclusive access to early-adopter programs.

**Website:** https://azure.microsoft.com / https://aws.amazon.com
**Scarcity technique:** Invitation-only or waitlist access to previews for strategic features.
**How it's presented:** "Request access" or "Join the waitlist" flows with limited cohort messaging.
**Why it's effective:** Scarcity here signals exclusivity and strategic advantage for early adopters.
