## What is a Sales Funnel?

<!-- 
Explain the concept of a sales funnel in simple terms.
Why is it called a "funnel"? What happens at each stage?
Include 1-2 paragraphs that anyone could understand.
-->

[A sales funnel describes the customer journey from first encountering a brand to becoming a paying customer. It is called a "funnel" because many people enter at the top (awareness) and progressively fewer move to the bottom (action). At each stage you provide different content and interactions to meet the customer's needs and reduce friction.

For an enterprise AI & cybersecurity advisory, the funnel should prioritize education and risk reduction early, then build credibility and low-friction conversion paths (assessments, pilots) that can be evaluated by procurement and technical stakeholders.]

### The AIDA Model
The most common framework for understanding sales funnels is **AIDA**:
- **A**wareness: Getting the customer's attention
- **I**nterest: Building curiosity about your product/service  
- **D**esire: Creating emotional connection and want
- **A**ction: Encouraging the final conversion (purchase, signup, etc.)

## Stage 1: Awareness
> *"How do we attract people who don't know about us yet?"*

### What Happens in This Stage
<!-- 
Explain what businesses are trying to accomplish in the awareness stage.
What is the visitor thinking/feeling? What are they looking for?
-->

[In Awareness, your goal is to be discoverable and communicate value clearly. Enterprise buyers often start with search, analyst reports, or referrals. For SageShield AI, awareness content should answer: Can this vendor reduce risk? Can they help us adopt AI responsibly?]

### Common Website Techniques

**Visual Elements:**
- Eye-catching hero images or videos
- Clear, compelling headlines
- Strong branding and logo placement
- Attractive color schemes and design

**Content Strategies:**
- SEO-optimized content
- Social media integration
- Blog posts and articles
- Free resources and tools

### Real Website Examples

#### Example 1: [Company Name]
**Website:** [URL]
**Business Type:** [Industry/category]

**Awareness Techniques:**
- **Hero Section:** [Describe their homepage hero area]
- **Headlines:** "[Quote their main headline]"
- **Visual Appeal:** [Describe their imagery/design]
- **Value Proposition:** [How they communicate what they do]

## Stage 2: Interest
> *"How do we keep visitors engaged and wanting to learn more?"*

### What Happens in This Stage
<!-- 
Explain what businesses are trying to accomplish in the interest stage.
The visitor is now paying attention - what do they need to see?
-->

[Interest is where buyers evaluate competence and fit. They look for documentation, product descriptions, and case studies. For services, this is the stage to present clear engagement models and deliverables that map to buyer roles (technical, legal, procurement).]

### Common Website Techniques

**Information Architecture:**
- Clear navigation menus
- Organized product/service categories
- Easy-to-find information
- Logical page flow

**Content Strategies:**
- Product demonstrations or tours
- Educational content
- Feature comparisons
- FAQ sections
- About us / company story

### Real Website Examples

#### Example 1: [Company Name]
**Interest-Building Techniques:**
- **Navigation:** [How they organize information]
- **Product Display:** [How they showcase offerings]
- **Educational Content:** [What they teach visitors]
- **Engagement Features:** [Interactive elements, videos, etc.]

## Stage 3: Desire
> *"How do we make visitors want what we're offering?"*

### What Happens in This Stage
<!-- 
Explain what businesses are trying to accomplish in the desire stage.
The visitor is interested - now how do you make them want it?
-->

[Desire is where risk reduction and value become personal: case studies that quantify outcomes, testimonials from similar companies, and clear ROI narratives move prospects from curiosity to preference.]

### Common Website Techniques

**Emotional Connection:**
- Customer success stories
- Lifestyle imagery
- Benefits-focused messaging (not just features)
- Problem/solution positioning

**Trust Building:**
- Customer testimonials and reviews
- Security badges and certifications  
- Money-back guarantees
- Company credentials and awards

**Urgency and Value:**
- Special offers or discounts
- Limited-time promotions
- Clear pricing and value propositions
- Risk-reduction messaging

### Real Website Examples

#### Example 1: [Company Name]
**Desire-Building Techniques:**
- **Emotional Appeals:** [How they connect emotionally]
- **Social Proof:** [Testimonials, reviews, etc.]
- **Value Proposition:** [How they demonstrate value]
- **Trust Signals:** [Security, guarantees, credentials]

## Stage 4: Action
> *"How do we convert interested visitors into customers?"*

### What Happens in This Stage
<!-- 
Explain what businesses are trying to accomplish in the action stage.
The visitor wants what you offer - how do you make conversion easy?
-->

[Action is where procurement and legal get involved. Make the conversion path clear: simple contact forms, brief discovery calls, easy-to-understand statements of work (SOW) templates, and pilot agreements with defined success metrics.]

### Common Website Techniques

**Call-to-Action (CTA) Optimization:**
- Clear, prominent buttons
- Action-oriented language ("Get Started," "Buy Now," "Sign Up")
- Strategic placement throughout the site
- Contrasting colors that stand out

**Conversion Process:**
- Simple, streamlined forms
- Guest checkout options
- Multiple payment methods
- Progress indicators
- Mobile-friendly design

**Final Persuasion:**
- Urgency messaging
- Risk reduction (free trial, money-back guarantee)
- Contact information and support options
- Exit-intent popups or offers

### Real Website Examples

#### Example 1: [Company Name]
**Action-Driving Techniques:**
- **Call-to-Action:** "[Quote their main CTA button text]"
- **Button Design:** [Describe color, placement, style]
- **Conversion Process:** [How easy is it to buy/sign up?]
- **Final Persuasion:** [Last-minute techniques they use]

## Complete Funnel Analysis

### Full Customer Journey Example
<!-- 
Choose ONE website and trace a complete path through all four stages.
This could be an e-commerce site, service provider, SaaS company, etc.
-->


**Company:** CrowdStrike
**Website:** https://www.crowdstrike.com
**Business Type:** Enterprise cybersecurity platform

| Stage | Website Section | Specific Techniques | Customer Mindset |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Awareness** | Homepage, Resources | Research reports, blog, SEO, analyst mentions | "Who can help us understand this threat?" |
| **Interest** | Solutions, Product pages | Technical docs, webinars, datasheets | "Can they integrate with our stack and meet compliance?" |
| **Desire** | Case studies, demos | Customer stories with telemetry, ROI figures | "This looks proven for organizations like ours" |
| **Action** | Contact / Demo / Trials | Clear CTA to request demo, sales contact, trial programs | "Let's schedule a demo and pilot this" |

**Overall Effectiveness:** CrowdStrike's funnel is strong (8/10). Their research and telemetry build authority, and customer stories make the case for adoption. The weakest area is sometimes the number of stakeholder-specific materials (e.g., CFO-level ROI summaries) which could be expanded.

## Connection to Team Research

### How This Connects to Our Archetype
<!-- 
Reference your teammate's archetype research. How should the brand personality 
influence the sales funnel? Be specific.
-->

[The Sage archetype means content should prioritize clarity, evidence, and instruction. At Awareness, publish clear executive summaries; at Interest provide technical depth; at Desire use evidence-backed case studies; and at Action provide documented steps and SOW templates to lower legal and procurement friction.]

### How This Connects to Persuasion Principles

Reference your teammate's persuasion research. Which principles work best 
at each stage of the funnel?
-->


**Recommended Persuasion Techniques by Stage:**
- **Awareness:** Authority & Reciprocity — publish credible research and free guides to attract smart buyers.
- **Interest:** Consistency & Liking — offer small commitments (download a checklist) and use an approachable, expert voice.
- **Desire:** Social Proof & Authority — case studies and analyst citations that validate claims.
- **Action:** Scarcity & Reciprocity — limited pilot slots or free advisory calls can accelerate scheduling; follow up with tailored deliverables.
