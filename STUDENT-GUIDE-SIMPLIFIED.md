### üß† **Persuasion Principles** (If this is your topic)
<details>
<summary><strong>üìñ What are Cialdini's 6 principles? (Click to read - 3 mins)</strong></summary>

**Simple explanation:** Psychologist Robert Cialdini discovered 6 ways people are influenced to say "yes."

**The 6 Principles:**

1. **Reciprocity** - "Give to get"
   - Example: Free samples, free trials, free shipping
   - Psychology: People feel obligated to return favors

2. **Scarcity** - "Limited availability"
   - Example: "Only 3 left!", "Sale ends tonight!", limited editions
   - Psychology: We want things more when they're rare

3. **Authority** - "Trust the experts"
   - Example: "9/10 dentists recommend", celebrity endorsements, certifications
   - Psychology: We follow credible experts

4. **Consistency** - "Small yes leads to big yes"
   - Example: Email signup before checkout, quizzes, progress tracking
   - Psychology: We act consistently with previous commitments

5. **Liking** - "Buy from people we like"
   - Example: Friendly brand voice, relatable ambassadors, shared values
   - Psychology: We say yes to people similar to us

6. **Social Proof** - "Everyone else is doing it"
   - Example: Reviews, testimonials, "Join 1M+ users"
   - Psychology: We look to others when uncertain

**Why it matters:** Every successful website uses these principles to guide customer decisions.

**Your job:** Find real examples of each principle being used by brands in your category.

</details>

### üé¢ **Sales Funnel** (If this is your topic)
<details>
<summary><strong>üìñ What is a sales funnel? (Click to read - 3 mins)</strong></summary>

**Simple explanation:** A sales funnel is the journey from "Who are you?" to "Take my money!"

**The AIDA Framework:**

1. **AWARENESS** - "Getting attention"
   - Website: Hero image, headline, first impression
   - Goal: Make them notice you and stay on the page
   - Psychology: You have 3 seconds before they bounce

2. **INTEREST** - "Building curiosity"
   - Website: Product info, features, benefits
   - Goal: Make them want to learn more
   - Psychology: Answer "What's in it for me?"

3. **DESIRE** - "Creating emotional connection"
   - Website: Testimonials, social proof, success stories
   - Goal: Make them want what you're offering
   - Psychology: Emotion drives decisions, logic justifies

4. **ACTION** - "Converting to customer"
   - Website: Clear CTA button, easy checkout, urgency
   - Goal: Make buying easy and obvious
   - Psychology: Remove friction and fear

**Why it matters:** Understanding the funnel helps you design websites that actually convert visitors to customers.

**Your job:** Map out how websites in your category guide users through these 4 stages.
